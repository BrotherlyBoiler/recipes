Ingredients:
 - 1/4 cup butter /cubed
 - 2 Tbsp. brown sugar
 - 1/2 tsp salt
 - 1 cup water
 - 1 cup flour
 - 1 tsp vanilla
 - 4 eggs
 - cooking oil spray
 - oil for frying
 - cinnamon sugar
 - ice cream
 - hot fudge and caramel topping (optional)
 - 6-12 cup muffin tin

Directions:
 1. In a medium saucepan over medium/high heat - add butter, brown sugar, salt,
    and water - bring to a boil. As soon as the butter has fully melted and the
    mixture begins to boil, reduce the heat to medium/low and add in flour.
    Using a wooden spoon, stir until the dough comes together into a ball (about
    1 minute). Remove from heat and let cool for 5 minutes before proceeding to
    the next step (to prevent accidentally cooking the eggs).

 2. Mix in the vanilla extract and add in the eggs, one at a time, being sure to
    fully incorporate each egg before adding the next. Once all the eggs are
    incorporated, transfer it to a piping bag with a small star tip.

 3. Invert a muffin tin and spray thoroughly with non-stick cooking spray. Pipe
    the dough around the inverted cups in spirals to form the bowls. Immediately
    transfer the tray to the freezer and freeze until solid (about 3 hours or
    overnight).

 4. Heat oil in a deep pot to 350˚F (175˚C). Remove the muffin tin from the
    freezer and flex it to release the churro bowls (you may need to also use a
    small knife under the bottom edge to initially release them). Return any
    extras to the freezer while you wait to fry.

 5. Fry them in batches, until nicely browned - no more than 3 at a time. Be sure
    to carefully tip them into the oil so they sink to the bottom. Once desired
    color is reached remove them from the oil to a paper towel lined plate. Dab
    off any excess oil then roll them in a cinnamon sugar mixture. Fill with you
    favorite ice cream and toppings. Enjoy!
